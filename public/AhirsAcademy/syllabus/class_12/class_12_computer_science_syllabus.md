Python Programming 
●Read a text file line by line and display each word separated by a #.
●Read a text file and display the number of vowels/consonants/uppercase/lowercase
characters in the file.
●Remove all the lines that contain the character 'a' in a file and write it to another file.
●Create a binary file with name and roll number. Search for a given roll number and
display the name, if not found display appropriate message.
●Create a binary file with roll number, name and marks. Input a roll number and update
the marks.
●Write a random number generator that generates random numbers between 1 and 6
(simulates a dice).


--- Page 4 ---
●Write a Python program to implement a stack using list.
●Create a CSV file by entering user-id and password, read and search the password for
given userid.
Database Management 
●Create a student table and insert data. Implement the following SQL commands on the
student table:
o ALTER table to add new attributes / modify data type / drop attribute
o UPDATE table to modify data
o ORDER By to display data in ascending / descending order
o DELETE to remove tuple(s)
o GROUP BY and find the min, max, sum, count and average
●Similar exercise may be framed for other cases.
●Integrate SQL with Python by importing suitable module.
7. Suggested Reading Material
●NCERT Textbook for COMPUTER SCIENCE (Class XII)
●Support Materials on the CBSE website.
8. Project
The aim of the class project is to create something that is tangible and useful using Python 
file handling/ Python-SQL connectivity. This should be done in groups of two to three 
students and should be started by students at least 6 months before the submission 
deadline. The aim here is to find a real world problem that is worthwhile to solve.  
Students are encouraged to visit local businesses and ask them about the problems that 
they are facing. For example, if a business is finding it hard to create invoices for filing GST 
claims, then students can do a project that takes the raw data (list of transactions), groups 
the transactions by category, accounts for the GST tax rates, and creates invoices in the 
appropriate format. Students can be extremely creative here. They can use a wide variety of 
Python libraries to create user friendly applications such as games, software for their school, 
software for their disabled fellow students, and mobile applications, of course to do some of 
these projects, some additional learning is required; this should be encouraged. Students 
should know how to teach themselves.  
The students should be sensitized to avoid plagiarism and violations of copyright issues while 
working on projects. Teachers should take necessary measures for this.
