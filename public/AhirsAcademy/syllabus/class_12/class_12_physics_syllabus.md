 All  questions  included  in  the  question  papers  should  be  related  to  the  listed  practicals. 
 Every question should require about two minutes to be answered. 
 These  students  are  also  required  to  maintain  a  practical  file.  A  student  is  expected  to 
 record  at  least  five  of  the  listed  experiments  as  per  the  specific  instructions  for  each 
 subject.  These  practicals  should  be  duly  checked  and  signed  by  the  internal 
 examiner. 
 The  format  of  writing  any  experiment  in  the  practical  file  should  include  aim, 
 apparatus  required,  simple  theory,  procedure,  related  practical  skills,  precautions 
 etc. 
 Questions  may  be  generated  jointly  by  the  external/internal  examiners  and  used  for 
 assessment. 
 The  viva  questions  may  include  questions  based  on  basic  theory/principle/concept, 
 apparatus/  materials/chemicals  required,  procedure,  precautions,  sources  of  error 
 etc.

 B.  List of Practicals
 1.  To determine the resistance per cm of a given wire by plotting a graph between
 voltage and current.
 2.  To verify the laws of combination (series/parallel combination) of resistances by
 Ohm’s law.
 3.  To find the resistance of a given wire / standard resistor using a meter bridge.
 4.  To determine the resistance of a galvanometer by half deflection method.
 5.  To identify a resistor, capacitor, inductor and diode from a mixed collection of
 such items.
 6.  To observe the difference between
 (i)  a convex lens and a concave lens
 (ii)  a convex mirror and a concave mirror and to estimate the likely
 difference between the power of two given convex /concave lenses.
 7.  To design an inductor coil and to know the effect of
 (i)  change in the number of turns

 (ii)  Introduction of ferromagnetic material as its core material on the
 inductance of the coil.
 8.  To design a (i) step up (ii) step down transformer on a given core and know the
 relation between its input and output voltages.
 Note:  The above practicals may be carried out in an  experiential manner rather than 
 recording observations.
