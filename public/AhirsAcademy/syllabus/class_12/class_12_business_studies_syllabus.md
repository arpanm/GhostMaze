PROJECT WORK IN BUSINESS STUDIES FOR CLASS XI AND XII 
 
Introduction  
 
The course in Business Studies is introduced at Senior School level to provide students 
with a sound understanding of the principles and practices bearing in business (trade 
and industry) as well as their relationship with the society. Business is a dynamic 
process that brings together technology, natural resources and human initiative in a 
constantly changing global environment. With the purpose to help them understand the 
framework within which a business operates, and its interaction with the social, 
economic, technological and legal environment, the CBSE has introduced Project Work 
in the Business Studies Syllabus for Classes XI and XII. The projects have been 
designed to allow students to appreciate that business is an integral component of 
society and help them develop an understanding of the social and ethical issues 
concerning them. 
 
The project work also aims to empower the teacher to relate all the concepts with what is 
happening around the world and the student’s surroundings, making them appear more 
clear and contextual. This will enable the student to enjoy studies and use his free time 
effectively in observing what’s happening around. 
 
By means of Project Work the students are exposed to life beyond textbooks giving them 
opportunities to refer materials, gather information, analyze it further to obtain relevant 
information and decide what matter to keep.  
 
Objectives  
 
After doing the Project Work in Business Studies, the students will be able to do the 
following:  
 
develop a practical approach by using modern technologies in the field of 
business and management;  
 
get an opportunity for exposure to the operational environment in the field of 
business management and related services;   
 
inculcate important skills of team work, problem solving, time management, 
information 
collection, 
processing, 
analysing 
and
