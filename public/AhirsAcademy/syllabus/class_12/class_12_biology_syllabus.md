General Guidelines 

The practical examination will be of two hour duration. A separate list of ten experiments
is included here.

The written examination in practicals for these students will be conducted at the time of
practical examination of all other students.

The written test will be of 30 minutes duration.

The question paper given to the students should be legibly typed. It should contain a total
of 15 practical skill based very short answer type questions. A student would be required
to answer any 10 questions.

A writer may be allowed to such students as per CBSE examination rules.

All questions included in the question paper should be related to the listed practicals. Every
question should require about two minutes to be answered.

These students are also required to maintain a practical file. A student is expected to record
at least five of the listed experiments as per the specific instructions for each subject. These
practicals should be duly checked and signed by the internal examiner.

The format of writing any experiment in the practical file should include aim, apparatus
required, simple theory, procedure, related practical skills, precautions etc.

Questions may be generated jointly by the external/internal examiners and used for
assessment.

The viva questions may include questions based on basic theory / principle / concept,
apparatus / materials / chemicals required, procedure, precautions, sources of error etc.
Class XII
