Conduct of Periodic Tests: 
Periodic Test is a Pen and Paper assessment which is to be conducted by the respective 
subject teacher. The format of periodic test must have questions items with a balance mix, 
such as, very short answer (VSA), short answer (SA) and long answer (LA) to effectively 
assess the knowledge, understanding, application, skills, analysis, evaluation and synthesis. 
Depending on the nature of subject, the subject teacher will have the liberty of incorporating 
any other types of questions too. The modalities of the PT are as follows: 
a) Mode: The periodic test is to be taken in the form of pen-paper test.
b) Schedule: In the entire Academic Year, three Periodic Tests in each subject may be
conducted as follows:
Test 
Pre Mid-term (PT-I) Mid-Term (PT-II) 
Post Mid-Term (PT-III) 
Tentative Month 
July-August 
November 
December-January 
This is only a suggestive schedule and schools may conduct periodic tests as per their 
convenience. The winter bound schools would develop their own schedule with similar time 
gaps between two consecutive tests. 
c)
Average of Marks: Once schools complete the conduct of all the three periodic tests,
they will convert the weightage of each of the three tests into ten marks each for identifying
best two tests. The best two will be taken into consideration and the average of the two
shall be taken as the final marks for PT.
d)
The school will ensure simple documentation to keep a record of performance as
suggested in detail circular no.Acad-05/2017.
e)
Sharing of Feedback/Performance: The students’ achievement in each test must be
shared with the students and their parents to give them an overview of the level of learning
that has taken place during different periods. Feedback will help parents formulate
interventions (conducive ambience, support materials, motivation and morale-boosting)
to further enhance learning. A teacher, while sharing the feedback with student or parent,
should be empathetic, non- judgmental and motivating. It is recommended that the
teacher share best examples/performances of IA with the class to motivate all learners.

Assessment of Activity Work: 
Throughout the year any 10 activities shall be performed by the student from the activities 
given in the NCERT Laboratory Manual for the respective class (XI or XII) which 
is available on the link: ncert.nic.in/exemplar/labmanuals.html a record of the same
may be kept by the student. An year end test on the activity may be conducted  
The weightage are as under: 

The activities performed by the student throughout the year and record keeping
: 5 marks

Assessment of the activity performed during the year end test:  3 marks

Viva-voce: 2 marks
