Annexure I 
Guidelines for Internal Assessment 
Classes XI-XII 
ALS must be seen as an integrated component of all four language skills rather than a compartment 
of two. Suggested activities, therefore, take into consideration an integration of the four language skills 
but during assessment, emphasis will be given to speaking and listening, since reading and writing are 
already being assessed in the written exam. 
Classes XI-XII 
Total Marks: 20 
Assessment of Listening and Speaking Skills: (5+5=10 Marks) 
i.
Activities:
●
Subject teachers must refer to books prescribed in the syllabus.
●
In addition to the above, teachers may plan their own activities and create their own
material for assessing the listening and speaking skills.
ii.
Parameters for Assessment: The listening and speaking skills are to be assessed on the
following parameters:
a.
Interactive competence (Initiation & turn taking, relevance to the topic)
b.
Fluency (cohesion, coherence and speed of delivery)
c.
Pronunciation
d.
Language (grammar and vocabulary)
A suggestive rubric is given below:

--- Page 6 ---
iii.
Schedule:
The practice of listening and speaking skills should be done throughout the academic year.
The final assessment of the skills is to be done as per the convenience and schedule of the
school.
Project Work + Viva: 10 Marks 
Out of ten marks, 5 marks will be allotted for the project report/script /essay etc. and 5 marks for the viva. 
I.
Schedule:
●
Schools may refer to the suggestive timeline given in these guidelines for the planning,
preparation and viva-voce of ALS based projects.
●
The final assessment of the skills may be done on the basis of parameters suggested by the
Board. Language teachers, however, have the option to adopt/ modify these parameters
according to their school specific requirements.
II.
Suggestions for Project Work:

The Project can be inter-disciplinary in theme. The ideas/issues highlighted in the chapters/
poems/ drama given the prescribed books can also be developed in the form of a project.
Students can also take up any relevant and age-appropriate theme.
Such topics may be taken up that provide students with opportunities for listening
and speaking. Some suggestions are as follows:
a) Interview-Based research:
Example: 

Students can choose a topic on which to do their research/ interview, e.g. a student can choose
the topic : “ Evolving food tastes in my neighbourhood” or “Corona pandemic and the fallout on
families.” Read the available literature.

The student then conducts interviews with a few neighbours on the topic. For an interview, with
the help of the teacher, student will frame questions based on the preliminary
research/background.


The student will then write an essay/ write up / report etc. up to 1000 words on his/her research
and submit it. He
/ She will then take a viva on the research project. The project can be done in individually or in
pairs/ groups
b)
Students listen to podcasts/ interviews/radio or TV documentary on a topic and prepare a report
countering or agreeing with the speakers. Write an 800 - 1000 words report and submit. Take a
viva on the report.
c)
Students create their own video/ Audio, after writing a script. Before they decide a format, the
following elements can be taken into consideration:
●
Theme/topic of the audio / video. Would the child like to pick a current issue or something artistic
like theatre?
●
What are the elements that need to be part of the script?
●
Will the video/audio have an interview with one or more guests?
●
Would they prefer to improvise while chatting with guests, or work from a script?
●
What would be the duration?
●
How would they present the script/report to the teacher, e.g. Can it be in the form of a narrative?
d) Students write, direct and present a theatrical production, /One act play
This will be a project which will be done as a team. It will involve planning, preparation and
presentation. In short, various language skills will be utilised. There will be researching, discussion,
writing the script, auditioning and ultimately producing the play. The project will end with a
presentation and subsequently a viva. Teachers will be able to assess the core language skills of
the students and help them grow as 21st century critical thinkers.
III. Instructions for the Teachers:-
1.
Properly orient students about the Project work, as per the present Guidelines.
2.
Facilitate the students in the selection of theme and topic.
3.
Create a rubric for assessment and share with the students before they start so that they
know the parameters of assessment:

Teachers need to familiarize themselves with the method of assessing students with
the rubric-- a table with different criteria and a grading scale.

Choose the criteria on which you will grade students and list them along the left side of the
page.

Create an even number of columns along the top of the page. These columns will
represent potential skill levels of the students.

Assessing students on four/five criteria is an easy way to begin. For each criterion,
define the ability that a student would exhibit at each of the levels.

The more detailed you make your criteria, the easier it will be to evaluate each
student and define the level at which the student is presenting.
{Sample Rubric is attached at the end for reference} 
IV. Parameters for Overall Assessment:-
1. Pronunciation:

When evaluating the pronunciation of the students, teachers must listen for clearly articulated
words, pronunciation of unusual spellings and intonation.

Assess the students for the pronunciation skills and determine at which level the student needs
improvement.


--- Page 8 ---
2. Vocabulary:

After noting their pronunciation levels, evaluate the students on the use of extensive and
appropriate vocabulary during the viva. Check if students are using vocabulary appropriate to
the context about which they are speaking.
3.
Accuracy:

Grammar has always been an important component of language skills. As students speak/
answer the questions during the viva, listen to their grammatical structures. Are they
competent enough to use multiple tenses? Is their word order correct in a given sentence? An
effective speaker will automatically use the correct grammatical structures of his language.
4. Communication:

Assessing the communication skills of the students means looking at more than language.
Look at how creatively students use the language to make their points understood. Students
with a low level of vocabulary and grammar may still have good communication skills if they are
able to make the teacher understand their point of view.
5. Interaction:

During the viva teachers need to ask the students some questions. Questions need to be based
on the projects that have been suggested or chosen by the students.

It is imperative for a teacher to read the essays/project reports before they can be ready to ask
questions.

Teachers need to observe how students answer the questions that are posed to them: Are they
able to understand and answer questions independently or can they answer only when the
questions are translated into simpler words or repeated? Are they able to give appropriate
responses in a conversation?

These elements of interaction are necessary for clear and effective communication. A
student with effective interaction skills will be able to answer questions with relative ease and
follow the flow of conversation.
6. Fluency:

Fluency may be the easiest quality to judge in the students’ speech: How comfortable are they
as they speak and express themselves? How easily do the words come out? Are there
inappropriate pauses and gaps in the way a student speaks?

Fluency is a judgement of this communication and is an important criterion when evaluating
speaking skills. These criteria: pronunciation, vocabulary, accuracy, interaction and fluency are
all the hallmarks of a student's overall speaking abilities.

Teachers must also remember that some students may excel in one area and struggle in
another. Helping the students understand these issues will enable them to become effective
speakers in future. Let your students know that you will be assessing them in these various
areas when you evaluate their progress and encourage them to work and improve in these
areas.

Finally, teachers must remember that a proper evaluation of the students will take into
consideration more than just one oral interview on the final ASL project. Teachers must
take note of a student’s progress throughout the academic year.
