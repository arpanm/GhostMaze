PROJECT WORK IN BUSINESS STUDIES FOR CLASS XI AND XII 
Introduction  
The course in Business Studies is introduced at Senior School level to provide students 
with a sound understanding of the principles and practices bearing in business (trade 
and industry) as well as their relationship with the society. Business is a dynamic 
process that brings together technology, natural resources and human initiative in a 
constantly changing global environment. With the purpose to help them understand the 
framework within which a business operates, and its interaction with the social, 
economic, technological and legal environment, the CBSE has introduced Project Work 
in the Business Studies Syllabus for Classes XI and XII. The projects have been 
designed to allow students to appreciate that business is an integral component of 
society and help them develop an understanding of the social and ethical issues 
concerning them. 
The project work also aims to empower the teacher to relate all the concepts with what is 
happening around the world and the student’s surroundings, making them appear more 
clear and contextual. This will enable the student to enjoy studies and use his free time 
effectively in observing what’s happening around. 
By means of Project Work the students are exposed to life beyond textbooks giving them 
opportunities to refer materials, gather information, analyze it further to obtain relevant 
information and decide what matter to keep.  
Objectives 
After doing the Project Work in Business Studies, the students will be able to do the 
following:  

develop a practical approach by using modern technologies in the field of
business and management;

get an opportunity for exposure to the operational environment in the field of
business management and related services;

inculcate important skills of team work, problem solving, time management,
information 
collection, 
processing, 
analysing 
and 
synthesizing 
relevant
information to derive meaningful conclusions

get involved in the process of research work; demonstrate his or her capabilities
while working independently and

make studies an enjoyable experience to cherish.
CLASS XI: GUIDELINES FOR TEACHERS 
This section provides some basic guidelines for the teachers to launch the projects in 
Business Studies. It is very necessary to interact, support, guide, facilitate and 
encourage students while assigning projects to them.  
The teachers must ensure that the project work assigned to the students whether 
individually or in group are discussed at different stages right from assignment to drafts 
review and finalization. Students should be facilitated in terms of providing relevant 


--- Page 9 ---
materials or suggesting websites, or obtaining required permissions from business 
houses, malls etc for their project. The periods assigned to the Project Work should be 
suitably spaced throughout the academic session. The teachers MUST ensure that the 
students actually go through the rigors and enjoy the process of doing the project rather 
than depending on any readymade material available commercially.  
The following steps might be followed: 
1.
Students must take any one topic during the academic session of Class XI.
2.
The project may be done in a group or individually.
3.
The topic should be assigned after discussion with the students in the class and
should then be discussed at every stage of submission of the draft/final project
work.
4.

process of project completion.
5.
The teachers must ensure that the student’s self esteem should go up, and he
/she should be able to enjoy this process.
6.
The project work for each term should culminate in the form of Power Point
Presentation/Exhibition/ Skit before the entire class. This will help in developing
ICT and communication skills among them.
The teacher should help students to identify any one project from the given 
topics.
