Business is a dynamic \nprocess that brings together technology, natural resources and human initiative in a \nconstantly changing global environment. With the purpose to help them understand the \nframework within which a business operates, and its interaction with the social, \neconomic, technological and legal environment, the CBSE has introduced Project Work \nin the Business Studies Syllabus for Classes XI and XII. The projects have been \ndesigned to allow students to appreciate that business is an integral component of \nsociety and help them develop an understanding of the social and ethical issues \nconcerning them. \nThe project work also aims to empower the teacher to relate all the concepts with what is \nhappening around the world and the student’s surroundings, making them appear more \nclear and contextual. This will enable the student to enjoy studies and use his free time \neffectively in observing what’s happening around. \nBy means of Project Work the students are exposed to life beyond textbooks giving them \nopportunities to refer materials, gather information, analyze it further to obtain relevant \ninformation and decide what matter to keep.  \nObjectives \nAfter doing the Project Work in Business Studies, the students will be able to do the \nfollowing:  \n\ndevelop a practical approach by using modern technologies in the field of\nbusiness and management;\n\nget an opportunity for exposure to the operational environment in the field of\nbusiness management and related services;\n\ninculcate important skills of team work, problem solving, time management,\ninformation \ncollection, \nprocessing, \nanalysing \nand \nsynthesizing \nrelevant\ninformation to derive meaningful conclusions\n\nget involved in the process of research work; demonstrate his or her capabilities\nwhile working independently and\n\nmake studies an enjoyable experience to cherish.\nCLASS XI: GUIDELINES FOR TEACHERS \nThis section provides some basic guidelines for the teachers to launch the projects in \nBusiness Studies. It is very necessary to interact, support, guide, facilitate and \nencourage students while assigning projects to them.  \nThe teachers must ensure that the project work assigned to the students whether \nindividually or in group are discussed at different stages right from assignment to drafts \nreview and finalization. Students should be facilitated in terms of providing relevant \n\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nmaterials or suggesting websites, or obtaining required permissions from business \nhouses, malls etc for their project. The periods assigned to the Project Work should be \nsuitably spaced throughout the academic session. The teachers MUST ensure that the \nstudents actually go through the rigors and enjoy the process of doing the project rather \nthan depending on any readymade material available commercially.  \nThe following steps might be followed: \n1.\nStudents must take any one topic during the academic session of Class XI.\n2.\nThe project may be done in a group or individually.\n3.\nThe topic should be assigned after discussion with the students in the class and\nshould then be discussed at every stage of submission of the draft/final project\nwork.\n4.\nThe teacher should play the role of a facilitator and should closely supervise the\nprocess of project completion.\n5.\nThe teachers must ensure that the student’s self esteem should go up, and he\n/she should be able to enjoy this process.\n6.\nThe project work for each term should culminate in the form of Power Point\nPresentation/Exhibition/ Skit before the entire class. This will help in developing\nICT and communication skills among them.\nThe teacher should help students to identify any one project from the given \ntopics. \nI. Project One: Field Visit\nThe objective of introducing this project among the students is to give a first hand \nexperience to them regarding the different types of business units operating in their \nsurroundings, to observe their features and activities and relate them to the theoretical \nknowledge given in their text books.
