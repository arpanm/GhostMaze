DEMOCRACY AND EQUALITY
Rationale
Democracy and Equality are the key ideas to be engaged with this year. The effort is to introduce
the learner to certain core concepts, such as equality, dignity, rule of law etc that influence Democracy
as a political system. The role of the Constitution as a document that provides the guiding
framework to function in a democratic manner is emphasised.   This section deals with making
the link between democracy and how it manifests itself in institutional systems in a concrete and
live manner through case studies and real experiences. The objective is not to represent democracy
as a fixed idea or system, but one that is changing and evolving. The learner is introduced to a
wide range of institutions- the government, the bureaucracy and civil society organizations like the
Media so that she can develop a broad understanding of the relationship between the State and
Citizens.
Equality as a value is explored in some detail, where its relationship with democracy is highlighted
and the challenges or questions it raises on inequities and hierarchies that exist at present in society
is also discussed. An analysis of everyday experiences in the domain of gender enable the learner
to understand how these are related to the creation of differences that are discriminatory in
nature.
Objectives
The specific objectives of the course, where it is not clear from the rationale of the approach, are
indicated beside the themes to be taught in the course.
