It divulges profit or loss for a given period of time and nature and value of a firm’s assets, liabilities and owner’s’ equity.\nAccountancy or Accounting is a structure that is meant for measuring trade pursuits, actioning of data into reports and making the findings obtainable to the decision-makers. The documents, which collaborate these findings of the procurement of an establishment in monetary terms, are called financial statements. Accounting is elucidated as a ‘Business Language’.\nAccounting assists the establishment to be able to fix the financial position of the business. With all accounting pursuits, the ultimate report furnished assists the management to be aware of the business position, so they can be able to know which direction they are heading towards. Accountancy helps in taking significant economic decisions by scrutinising the past performance. A certificate or diploma in Accounting and Finance helps the students learn such skills that are helpful in different industries.\nStay tuned to BYJU’S for more information onCBSE Class 11 Syllabus, previous years question papers, important questions, exam pattern, sample papers and more.\nImportant Topics in Accountancy:What is a Balance Sheet?Partnership DeedWhat is Goodwill?Treatment of GoodwillWhat Is Partnership\nImportant Topics in Accountancy:What is a Balance Sheet?Partnership DeedWhat is Goodwill?Treatment of GoodwillWhat Is Partnership\nImportant Topics in Accountancy:What is a Balance Sheet?Partnership DeedWhat is Goodwill?Treatment of GoodwillWhat Is Partnership\nWhat is a Balance Sheet?\nPartnership Deed\nWhat is Goodwill?\nTreatment of Goodwill\nWhat Is Partnership\nFrequently Asked Questions on CBSE Accountancy Class 11 Syllabus 2023-24\nWhat are the units present in the Class 11 CBSE Syllabus for Accountancy 2023-24?\nHow many parts are present in the CBSE Accountancy Syllabus for Class 11?\nWhat is the marks distribution in the Class 11 Accountancy Syllabus for CBSE?",
