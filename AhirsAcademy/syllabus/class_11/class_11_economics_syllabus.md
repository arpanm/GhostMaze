Guidelines for Project Work in Economics (Class XI and XII) 
The objectives of the project work are to enable learners to: 

probe deeper into theoretical concepts learnt in classes XI and XII

analyse and evaluate real world economic scenarios using theoretical constructs and
arguments

demonstrate the learning of economic theory

follow up aspects of economics in which learners have interest

develop the communication skills to argue logically
The expectations of the project work are that: 
learners will complete only ONE project in each academic session
project should be of 3,500-4,000 words (excluding diagrams & graphs), preferably
hand-written
it will be an independent, self-directed piece of study
Role of the teacher: 
The teacher plays a critical role in developing thinking skills of the learners. A teacher should: 

help each learner select the topic based on recently published extracts from the news
media, government policies, RBI bulletin, NITI Aayog reports, IMF/World Bank reports etc.,
after detailed discussions and deliberations of the topic

play the role of a facilitator and supervisor to monitor the project work of the learner
through periodic discussions

guide the research work in terms of sources for the relevant data

educate learner about plagiarism and the importance of quoting the source of the
information to ensure authenticity of research work

prepare the learner for the presentation of the project work

arrange a presentation of the project file
Scope of the project: 
 Learners may work upon the following lines as a suggested flow chart: 
Choose a title/topic 
Collection of the research material/data 
 Organization of material/data 
Present material/data 
Analysing the material/data for conclusion 
Draw the relevant conclusion 
Presentation of the Project Work

Expected Checklist: 

Introduction of topic/title

Identifying the causes, consequences and/or remedies

Various stakeholders and effect on each of them

Advantages and disadvantages of situations or issues identified

Short-term and long-term implications of economic strategies suggested in the course of
research

Validity, reliability, appropriateness and relevance of data used for research work and
for presentation in the project file

Presentation and writing that is succinct and coherent in project file

Citation of the materials referred to, in the file in footnotes, resources section,
bibliography etc.
Mode of presentation/submission of the Project: 
At the end of the stipulated term, each learner will present the research work in the Project File 
to the External and Internal examiner. The questions should be asked from the Research 
Work/ Project File of the learner. The Internal Examiner should ensure that the study 
submitted by the learner is his/her own original work. In case of any doubt, authenticity 
should be checked and verified.
