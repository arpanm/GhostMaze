COMMUNICATIVE ENGLISH 
(Code No. 101)  
2023-24 
I. 
Introduction:
Acquiring a language means, above all, acquiring a means to communicate confidently and naturally. In other 
words, in order to communicate effectively in real life, students need more than mere knowledge about the 
language. In addition, they must be able to use the language effectively, with confidence and fluency. 
Therefore, the course in Communicative English has been designed to develop the practical language 
communication skills needed for academic study and subsequent adult life. 
The course brings together a number of ideas about the nature of language and language learning. 
Knowledge and Skill 
One of the tenets of the communicative approach is the idea that Language is a skill to be acquired, not 
merely a body of knowledge to be learnt. Acquiring a language has been compared to learning to drive. It is 
not enough to have only a theoretical knowledge of how an engine works: you must know how to use the 
gears and (crucially) how to interact with other road users. Similarly, simply knowing parts of speech or how 
to convert the active into the passive voice does not mean you are proficient in a language. You must be able 
to put knowledge into practice in everyday language use. Of course, we do not expect a novice driver to move 
off without preparation: the driver has rules of the highway which he/she must learn by rote. But there is no 
substitute for learning by doing, albeit in the artificial conditions of a deserted road at slow speeds. Equally in 
language learning there are some ‘rules to be learnt’ but there is no substitute for learning by doing. In good 
teaching, this experience is supported by carefully-graded, contextualized exercises. 
Structure and Function 
Language can be described in different ways. Obviously we can label an utterance according to its 
grammatical structure. Another approach is to decide what function it performs. Consider the following: 
a)
“Can I open the window?”
b)
“Can I carry that case?”
we could say that a) and b) have the same grammatical structure: they are both interrogative sentences. We 
should also recognize that they perform different functions: a) is a ‘request’ b) is an ‘offer’. 
The course aims to recognize the use to which language is put and encourages pupils to be aware of the 
relationship between structure and function. 
The overall aims of the course are to: 
(a) enable the learner to communicate effectively and appropriately in real-life situations;
(b) use English effectively for study purposes across the curriculum;
(c) develop and integrate the use of the four language skills, i.e., listening, speaking, reading and writing;
(d) develop interest in and appreciation of literature;
(e)
revise and reinforce structures already learnt.

To develop creativity, students should be encouraged to think on their own and express their ideas using their 
experience, knowledge and imagination, rather than being text or teacher dependent. Students should be 
encouraged to monitor their progress, space out their learning, so they should be encouraged to see language 
not just as a functional tool, but as an important part of personal development and inculcation of values.

Role of the Teacher
Unlike a teacher-centered classroom, where the teacher plays a dominant role, speaks most of the time, and 
interacts with the class as a whole, for the success of this course teachers will need to adopt a variety of 
roles. Teachers may note  that the number of periods given in this document is suggestive , as overlapping 
of skills may happen during classroom-transaction.  
Littlewood1 sets out the roles as follows: 
•
As a general overseer of his/ her students’ learning, the teacher must aim to coordinate the activities so
that they form a coherent progression, leading towards greater communicative ability.
•
As a classroom manager, he/ she is responsible for grouping activities into ‘lessons’ and for ensuring that
these are satisfactorily organized at a practical level.
•
In many activities, he/ she may perform the familiar role of language instructor: he/ she will present new
language, exercise direct control over the learner’s performance, evaluate and correct it, and so on.
•
In others, he/ she will not intervene after initiating the proceedings, but will let learning take place through
independent activity or pair and group work.
•
When such an activity is in progress s/he may act as a consultant or adviser, helping where necessary.
He/ She may also move about the classroom in order to monitor the strengths and weaknesses of the
learners, as a basis for planning future learning activities.
•
He /She will sometimes wish to participate in an activity as co-communicator with the learners. In this role,
he/ she can simulate and present new language without taking the main initiative for learning away from
the learners themselves.
IV.
Classroom Procedures
The main types of classroom organization recommended are individual work, pair work, small group work 
and whole class work. It has been the experience of teachers that students adapt themselves very quickly to 
the new classroom arrangements, and the interesting nature of the activities themselves produce discipline. 
The following sections give practical advice on organization of different types of classroom activities. 
1 Littlewood, W. (1981). Communicative language teaching. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 


--- Page 6 ---
Page 6 of 18 
Individual Work 
When an activity is designed for individual work, students will be working mainly on their own. First, ask 
students to read the instructions (or read them aloud to the students). Make sure that students understand 
what they are expected to do, if necessary by giving an example or (preferably) asking one of the students to 
give an example. Then set them to do the activity. 
While students do the activity, the teacher can move around the classroom, making sure that everything is 
going smoothly and giving individual help where it is needed. Do not interfere too much; remember that too 
much interruption and correction may discourage students. 
Students will work at different speeds, so they will not all finish at the same time. The easiest solutions to this 
is to ask students who have finished to compare their answers with their neighbours’. Call the class together 
again when the majority of them have finished the activity, even if some are still working on it. The activity 
can then be checked by asking students to give their answers. The teacher needn’t act as the ‘judge’, but 
instead can ask other students whether they agree. This checking procedure keeps all students involved, and 
gives the slower ones a chance to catch up. 
Pair Work 
As with individual work, you first need to make sure that students understand the instructions. Once the 
activity is clear, you will then have to arrange the class in pairs. Usually it is easiest if a student pairs up with 
the person sitting at the same desk. (You may have to move one or two if they are on their own.) 
Sometimes it will be necessary to have three working together, but this should not seriously affect their work. 


--- Page 7 ---
Page 7 of 18 
If your class is very crowded, with most students sitting three to a desk, one row may turn to face those 
behind to form three pairs. 
Once students have settled down to work, circulate round the classroom, observing and listening to them, 
and giving help to those who need it. As with individual work, resist the temptation to interfere too much! 
You may find it useful to set a time limit for pair work activity. This can help to focus the students’ attention 
and provide a challenge, as well as simplify management of the class. If you wish to do this, tell them the time 
limit before they begin, and be prepared to extend or reduce  if you find you have misjudged the time required. 
In many pair work tasks, checking can be carried out in the same way as for individual work by the teacher 
eliciting answers from the students. Sometimes, though, it may be better for one or more pairs of students to 
report back their conclusions to the rest of the class, possibly with a class discussion. 
Group work 
Usually, group work, involves four students but at times it may extend to five or six or even more. Four, 
however, is a more convenient number for most classroom situations. 
The general procedure for group work is the same as for pair work, that is: 
-
instructions for the whole class
-
organization of the groups
-
group activity while the teacher circulates
-
feedback and checking for the whole class


--- Page 8 ---
Page 8 of 18 
The major difference is that the organization of the groups needs more care. It is fairly simple to form groups 
of four by asking students to turn and face those behind. 
However, you may feel that some changes are required to achieve a balance in some of the groups. In this 
case, move only a few students from one group to another. When the groups move over to the feedback and 
checking stage, you may make it more interesting by asking a student to chair the inter-group discussion. 
Whole Class Work 
Whole class work, of course, is necessary for maters such as formal instruction (e.g. the format of formal and 
informal letters), for “warm-up” activities, for class discussion, for “class review” sessions at the close of pair 
work or group work. During the whole class work, the teacher is in her traditional role. 
V.
Handling Pair Work and Small Group Work (PW/SGW)
Introducing and Demonstrating 
After a brief explanation of what is to be done, always demonstrate the activity. You have these options: 
-
The teacher takes both (for all) parts.
-
The teacher takes one part, while one or more students take the other parts.
-
Two or more students take different parts.
In selecting students to help demonstrate an activity, always select those who will demonstrate it well. Also, 
choose students from different parts of the classroom (particularly from the back), so that they will have to 
speak loudly in order to be heard. (Don’t choose students sitting side-by-side, or they will speak so softly to 
each other that nobody else will hear!) Don’t allow this phase to take too much time – two or three minutes is 
usually enough. 
Organising 
This has largely been covered in the Section B.3.above. A few additional points: 
-
There is no need to move chairs and desks, and only a very few students will need to move places. For
the most part, students simply face in a different direction in order to form pairs and small groups.


--- Page 9 ---
Page 9 of 18 
-
The teacher is responsible for deciding who is to work with whom. (Don’t leave it to students to decide, or
the result will be confusion.)
-
You may also prefer to allocate roles yourself, e.g. “When pairs, the one nearest the window is A, the
other is B.”
-
If you have not used PW/SGW before, expect a little, noise and excitement at first! But students quickly
get used to the new procedures and soon settle down with minimum noise and fuss.
Managing 
While students are actually doing the PW/SGW activity, the teacher has an important role to play. It is vital to 
move round the class, listening in on PW / SGW and helping / advising where necessary. Be careful, of 
course, not to “take over” the activity by intervening too strongly. (Students need the English language 
practice, not you!) Sometimes it is advisable to just ‘hover’ at a distance while moving round the class, simply 
checking that students are actually doing the activity. Make sure that you distribute your attention evenly over 
the course of a term; and give particular help and attention to weaker students. 
Concluding 
At the close of a PW/SGW activity, bring the whole class together. You may wish to ask a pair or group to 
demonstrate what they have done at the front of the class. (Ask weaker pairs or groups to demonstrate, too. 
This can be a powerful confidence-builder). Alternatively, you may find a brief class discussion   profitable, in 
which students exchange experiences that have arisen from the activity itself, e.g. a problem they have 
encountered, a good idea someone came up with, something they did not understand. Be careful not to allow 
this conclusion phase to take too much time – 5 minute is plenty. 
Many teachers view with alarm the prospect of pair work and small group work with a large number of 
students. The following are concerns commonly expressed together with the responses of experienced 
teachers: 
VI.
Some questions and answers about Pair Work and Small Group Work
For many teachers, the prospect of PW/SGW with large numbers of students in a class is viewed with alarm. 
To help such teachers, the following are concerns expressed, followed by responses that have been given 
by other teachers. 
Teachers’ concerns about PW/SGW 
-
It is difficult for the teacher to check whether all students are doing the activity, and (if so) whether they are
producing correct and suitable English.
-
More proficient pupils take over weaker pupils.
-
Noise levels are high.
-
It is not right for the teacher to withdraw from a position of “central control”
-
PW/SGW will be rejected by other teachers, parents and by the students themselves as a waste of time
and frivolous.
Responses to these Concerns 
-
In traditional teacher-led classes, often individual students are not actively participating, but the teacher
remains unaware of this, if a sufficient students seem to be ‘following the lesson’.


--- Page 10 ---
Page 10 of 18 
-
Noise is a necessary element of good language learning – as it is in a Music lesson. It is not so much
noise itself that some teachers are concerned about, but the amount of noise. There is no easy answer
to this question, since a lot depends on the individual teacher’s relationship with the class. Certainly a
clear introduction to and demonstration of the task will ensure that PW/SGW gets off to a good start, with
no fuss and confusion. And the challenge of the task itself should ensure that students are busily engaged
in the English class. It is for the teacher to make it clear to the class what amount of noise is acceptable,
and to make sure that noise is kept to that level. If noise levels do get too high for comfort, the “noisy
approach” (i.e. the teacher shouting to get less noise) is unlikely to work for any more than a short while.
Instead, try the “quiet approach”, i.e. train your students to recognize that when your hand is raised, they
must raise theirs and be more quiet. On occasions, you may have to speak to particularly noisy and
excited groups. Please do not let the prospect of some degree of noise put you off PW/SGW. If students
are to learn to use English, then they must communicate with each other, not just you. And if they are to
communicate, then     there will be a certain amount of positive, beneficial noise. Welcome it as a sign
that your students are growing in confidence and fluency in English.
-
It is perfectly true that in PW/SGW the teacher cannot judge whether all students are producing correct
and suitable English. (Of course, this is equally true of a teacher-led classroom where one student is
speaking (to you), and all the others are silent.) But we need to accept that making mistakes in language
is not only normal, but is actually necessary if a learner is to make progress. Advice on what to do about
students’ mistakes when speaking in PW/SGW is given in Section C.6.
-
P/SGW encourages all students, even the shy ones, to participate actively. Because they feel they are
not “on show” in front of the whole class, they feel free to experiment with the language, trying out newly-
acquired forms.
- Much research in psycholinguistics in recent years has indicated that peer interaction of this kind in
language classes is frequently highly successful. Not all students, even those in the same class, have
precisely the same stock of knowledge and understanding of the language. Students can pool ideas and
often perform a task better together than they can alone. As they become more familiar with PW/SGW,
they learn to handle activities in a mature manner, sensitively correcting each other’s work. In fact, research
shows that appropriate error correction in well graded activities is just as likely to occur between students
as by the teacher in a teacher-led mode.
-
If a good student is paired with a less able one, the former is likely to assume the role of a ‘teacher’. This
experience is often fruitful for both. The less able student has a ‘personal tutor’, and the good student also
improves: having to explain something in simple terms is often an excellent learning experience in itself.
-
If a task is well-constructed and the students appropriately prepared, the activity often creates ‘peer
pressure’ to induce reluctant group members to participate.
-
PW/SGW is an attempt to encourage students to accept some of the responsibility for learning
themselves. The only truly successful students are the ones who can do this. If the technique is handled
well, it will soon become evident that the teacher is working just as hard as she/he does in a teacher-led
mode. PW/SGW is one of a number of different techniques which a teacher can employ to accommodate
students with different learning styles and for activities with different goals.

ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE 
Code No. 184 
2023-24 
1. Background
At the secondary stage of English language learning the textual materials and other resources 
should represent a wide range of learning experience. Literature has always played a significant 
role in learning language. However, it is felt that pupils should be apprised with contemporary 
issues, read authentic literature and experiences of people to reflect and build their personality 
traits. 
While there is a trend for inclusion of a wider range of contemporary and authentic texts, 
accessible and culturally appropriate pieces of literature should play a pivotal role at the 
secondary stage of education. The English class is meant for reading literature from different 
perspectives and to engage in activities for developing communicative competence, creativity 
and enrichment of language skills It should not be seen as a place merely to read poems and 
stories in, but an area of activities to develop the learner’s imagination as a major aim of language 
study, and to equip the learner with communicative skills to perform various language functions 
through speech and writing. 
2. Objectives:
Objectives of the course are to enable learners to: 
• build greater confidence and proficiency in oral and written communication
• develop the ability and knowledge required in order to engage in independent
reflection and inquiry
• make appropriate usage of English language
• to communicate in various social settings
• equip learners with essential language skills to question and to articulate their point of view
• build competence in the different aspects of the Language
• develop sensitivity to, and appreciation of world literature representing varieties of
English and cultures embedded in lt.
• enable the learner to access knowledge and information through reference
skills (consulting a dictionary / thesaurus, library, internet, etc.)
• develop curiosity and creativity through extensive reading
• facilitate self-learning to enable them to become independent learners
• review, organise and edit their own work and work done by peers
• integrate listening and speaking skills in the curriculum.
• give a brief oral description of events / incidents of topical interest
• retell the contents of authentic audio texts (weather reports, public announcements,

simple advertisements, short interviews, etc.) 
• participate in conversations, discussions, etc., on topics of mutual interest in non-classroom
situations
• narrate a story which has been depicted pictorially or in any other non-verbal mode
• respond, in writing, to business letters, official communications email etc.
• read and identify the main points / significant details of texts like scripts of
audio-video interviews, discussions, debates, etc.
• write without prior preparation on a given topic and be able to defend or explain the
stand taken / views expressed in the form of article, speech, or a debate
• write a summary of short lectures on familiar topics by making / taking notes
• write an assessment of different points of views expressed in a discussion / debate
• read poems effectively (with proper rhythm and intonation)
• transcode information from a graph / chart to a description / report and write a
dialogue, short story or report
• Develop appreciation for Indian languages(multilingualism), translations and Indian
Literature.
3. Language Items
In addition to consolidating the grammatical items practised earlier, the courses at the 
secondary level seek to reinforce the following explicitly: 
• sequence of tenses
• reported speech in extended texts
• modal auxiliaries (those not covered at upper primary)
• non-finites (infinitives, gerunds, participles)
• conditional clauses
• complex and compound sentences
• phrasal verbs and prepositional phrases
• cohesive devices
• punctuation (semicolon, colon, dash, hyphen, parenthesis or use of
brackets and exclamation mark)
4. Methods and Techniques
The methodology is based on a multi-skill, activity-based, learner-centered approach. Care is 
taken to fulfill the functional (communicative), literary (aesthetic) and cultural (sociological) 
needs of the learner. In this situation, the teacher is the facilitator of learning, She/he presents 
language items, create situations which motivates the child to use English for the purposes of 
communication and expression. Aural-oral teaching and testing is an integral feature of the 
teaching-learning process. The electronic and print media could be used extensively. A few 
suggested activities are:

NOTE: Teachers are advised to:
(i)
encourage classroom interaction among peers, students and teachers through
activities such as role play, group work etc.
(ii)
reduce teacher-talk time and keep it to the minimum,
(iii) take up questions for discussion to encourage pupils to participate and to marshal
their ideas and express and defend their views.
Besides measuring learning outcome, texts serve the dual purpose of diagnosing mistakes 
and areas of non-learning. To make evaluation a true index of learners’ knowledge, each 
language skill is to be assessed through a judicious mixture of different types of questions. 
Guidelines for the Assessment of Listening and Speaking Skills are given at Annexure I.
