line. Rational numbers as recurring/ terminating decimals. Operations on real numbers.
2. Examples of non-recurring/non-terminating decimals. Existence of non-rational numbers
(irrational numbers) such as
, 
 and their representation on the number line. Explaining

phenomenon 
into 
rigorous 
Mathematics 
with 
definitions, 
common/obvious 
notions,
axioms/postulates and theorems. The five postulates of Euclid. Showing the relationship
between axiom and theorem, for example:
(Axiom) 1. Given two distinct points, there exists one and only one line through them.
(Theorem) 2. (Prove) Two distinct lines cannot have more than one point in common.
2.
LINES AND ANGLES
(15) Periods
1. (Motivate) If a ray stands on a line, then the sum of the two adjacent angles so formed is 180O
and the converse.
2. (Prove) If two lines intersect, vertically opposite angles are equal.
3. (Motivate) Lines which are parallel to a given line are parallel.
3.

3. (Motivate) Two triangles are congruent if the three sides of one triangle are equal to three
sides of the other triangle (SSS Congruence).
4. (Motivate) Two right triangles are congruent if the hypotenuse and a side of one triangle are
equal (respectively) to the hypotenuse and a side of the other triangle. (RHS Congruence)
5. (Prove) The angles opposite to equal sides of a triangle are equal.

5. (Motivate) In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other and conversely.
6. (Motivate) In a triangle, the line segment joining the mid points of any two sides is parallel to
the third side and in half of it and (motivate) its converse.
5.
CIRCLES 
   (17) Periods
1.(Prove) Equal chords of a circle subtend equal angles at the center and (motivate) its
converse. 
2.(Motivate) The perpendicular from the center of a circle to a chord bisects the chord and 
conversely, the line drawn through the center of a circle to bisect a chord is perpendicular to 
the chord. 
3. (Motivate) Equal chords of a circle (or of congruent circles) are equidistant from the center
(or their respective centers) and conversely.
4.(Prove) The angle subtended by an arc at the center is double the angle subtended by it at any 
point on the remaining part of the circle. 
5.(Motivate) Angles in the same segment of a circle are equal. 
6.(Motivate) If a line segment joining two points subtends equal angle at two other points lying 
on the same side of the line containing the segment, the four points lie on a circle. 
7.(Motivate) The sum of either of the pair of the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral is 180° 
and its converse.
