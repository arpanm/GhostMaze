Note for the Teachers: 
1. The chapter Natural Resources (NCERT Chapter 14) will not be assessed in the year-end
examination. However, learners may be assigned to read this chapter and encouraged to
prepare a brief write up on any concept of this chapter in their Portfolio. This may be for
Internal Assessment and credit may be given for Periodic Assessment/Portfolio.
2. The NCERT text books present information in boxes across the book. These  help students
to get conceptual clarity. However, the information in these boxes would not be assessed
in the year-end examination.
PRACTICALS 
Practicals should be conducted alongside the concepts taught in theory classes.
