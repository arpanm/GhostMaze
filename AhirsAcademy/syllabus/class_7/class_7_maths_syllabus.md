CBSE Class 7 Syllabus for Maths  
2023-24 
 
Number System (50 hrs) 
 
1. Knowing our Numbers: Integers 
 
• Multiplication and division of integers (through patterns). Division by zero is meaningless  
 
• Properties of integers (including identities for addition & multiplication, commutative, associative, 
distributive) (through patterns). These would include examples from whole numbers as well. Involve 
expressing commutative and associative properties in a general form. Construction of 
counterexamples, including some by children. Counter examples like subtraction is not 
commutative.  
 
• Word problems including integers (all operations) 
 
2. Fractions and rational numbers 
• Multiplication of fractions  
 
• Fraction as an operator  
 
• Reciprocal of a fraction  
 
• Division of fractions  
 
• Word problems involving mixed fractions  
 
• Introduction to rational numbers (with representation on number line)  
 
• Operations on rational numbers (all operations) 
 
• Representation of rational number as a decimal.  
 
• Word problems on rational numbers (all operations)  
 
• Multiplication and division of decimal fractions  
 
• Conversion of units (length & mass)  
 
• Word problems (including all operations) 
 
3. Powers 
• Exponents only natural numbers. • Laws of exponents (through observing patterns to arrive at

generalisation.) 
 
 
Algebra (20 hrs)  
1. ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 
 
• Generate algebraic expressions (simple) involving one or two variables  
 
• Identifying constants, coefficient, powers  
 
• Like and unlike terms, degree of expressions e.g., x y 2 etc. (exponent≤ 3, number of variables) 
 
 • Addition, subtraction of algebraic expressions (coefficients should be integers).  
 
• Simple linear equations in one variable (in contextual problems) with two operations (avoid 
complicated coefficients) 
 
 
2. Ratio and Proportion (20 hrs) 
• Ratio and proportion (revision)  
 
• Unitary method continued, consolidation, general expression.  
 
• Percentage- an introduction.  
 
• Understanding percentage as a fraction with denominator 100  
 
• Converting fractions and decimals into percentage and vice-versa.  
 
• Application to profit and loss (single transaction only)  
 
• Application to simple interest (time period in complete years). 
 
 
Geometry (60 hrs) 
1. Understanding shapes:  
 
•Pairs of angles (linear, supplementary, complementary, adjacent, vertically opposite) 
(verification and simple proof of vertically opposite angles)  
 
• Properties of parallel lines with transversal (alternate, corresponding, interior, exterior angles) 
 
2. Properties of triangles: 
 
• Angle sum property (with notions of proof & verification through paper folding, proofs using 


--- Page 3 ---
 
 
 
 
property of parallel lines, difference between proof and verification.)  
• Exterior angle property • Sum of two sides of a it’s third side  
 
• Pythagoras Theorem (Verification only) 
 
3. Symmetry 
• Recalling reflection symmetry  
 
• Idea of rotational symmetry, observations of rotational symmetry of 2-D objects. (900, 1200, 
1800)  
 
• Operation of rotation through 900 and 1800 of simple figures.  
 
• Examples of figures with both rotation and reflection symmetry (both operations)  
 
• Examples of figures that have reflection and rotation symmetry and vice-versa 
 
 
4. Representing 3-D in 2-D 
• Drawing 3-D figures in 2-D showing hidden faces.  
 
• Identification and counting of vertices, edges, faces, nets (for cubes cuboids, and cylinders, 
cones).  
 
• Matching pictures with objects (Identifying names) 
 
• Mapping the space around approximately through visual estimation. 
 
 
5. Congruence 
• Congruence through superposition (examples, blades, stamps, etc.) 
 
• Extend congruence to simple geometrical shapes e.g. triangles, circles.  
 
• Criteria of congruence (by verification) SSS, SAS, ASA, RHS 
 
 
6. Construction (Using scale, protractor, compass) 
 
• Construction of a line parallel to a given line from a point outside it (Simple proof as remark 
with the reasoning of alternate angles)  
 
• Construction of simple triangles. Like given three sides, given a side and two angles on it, 
given two sides and the angle between them.

Mensuration (15 hrs) 
 
• Revision of perimeter, Idea of , Circumference of Circle 
 
Area  
Concept of measurement using a basic unit area of a square, rectangle, triangle, parallelogram 
and circle, area between two rectangles and two concentric circles 
 
 
Data handling (15 hrs) 
i) 
Collection and organisation of data – choosing the data to collect for a hypothesis testing.  
 
ii) 
Mean, median and mode of ungrouped data – understanding what they represent.  
 
iii) 
Constructing bargraphs  
 
iv) 
Feel of probability using data through experiments. Notion of chance in events like 
tossing coins, dice etc. Tabulating and counting occurrences of 1 through 6 in a number 
of throws. Comparing the observation with that for a coin. Observing strings of throws, 
notion of randomness.
