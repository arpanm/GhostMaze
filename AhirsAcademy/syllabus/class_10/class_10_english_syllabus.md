knowledge, each language skill is to be assessed through a judicious mixture of different
types of questions.

Annexure I 
Guidelines for Assessment of Listening and Speaking Skills (ALS) 
ALS is a component of the Subject Enrichment Activity under Internal Assessment. ALS must be 
seen as an integrated component of all four language skills rather than a compartment of two. 
Suggested activities, therefore, take into consideration an integration of the four language skills 
but during assessment, emphasis will be given to speaking and listening, since reading and 
writing are already being assessed in the written exam. 
Assessment of Listening and Speaking Skills: (5 Marks) 
i.
Activities:
●
Subject teachers must refer to books prescribed in the syllabus.
●
In addition to the above, teachers may plan their own activities and create their
own material for assessing the listening and speaking skills.
ii.
Parameters for Assessment: The listening and speaking skills are to be assessed
on the following parameters:
a.
Interactive competence (Initiation & turn taking, relevance to the topic)
b.
Fluency (cohesion, coherence and speed of delivery)
c.
Pronunciation
d.
Language (grammar and vocabulary)

 Guidelines for Assessment of Listening and Speaking Skills (ALS) 
  ALS is a component of the Subject Enrichment Activity under Internal Assessment. ALS must be seen 
as an integrated component of all four language skills. Suggested activities, therefore, take into 
consideration an integration of the four language skills but during assessment, emphasis will be given 
to speaking and listening, since reading and writing are already being assessed in the written exam. 
Assessment of Listening and Speaking Skills: (5 Marks) 
i.
Activities:
●
Subject teachers must refer to books prescribed in the syllabus.
●
In addition to the above, teachers may plan their own activities and create their own
material for assessing the listening and speaking skills.
ii.
Parameters for Assessment: The listening and speaking skills are to be assessed on the following
parameters:
a.
Interactive competence (Initiation & turn taking, relevance to the topic)
b.
Fluency (cohesion, coherence and speed of delivery)
c.
Pronunciation
d.
Language (grammar and vocabulary)
